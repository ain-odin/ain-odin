#### ✨ __About me__ ✨

Passionate junior front-end developer with a desire to learn and grow in a collaborative team environment.

My goal is to learn a pure JavaScript at a good level, learn the React library and become a confident frontend developer. 

Motherhood additionally strengthened my qualities such as patience, multitasking, attention to detail.

#### ✨ __Experience__ ✨

Before entering IT I used to be a barista, a grafic designer and become a mom. 

This experience taught me patience, the ability to get to the bottom and the skill of brewing coffee for every taste. Tea too.
